Instructions for adding your Instagram photos to the bento grid:

1. Download 12 photos from your Instagram account
2. Rename them to photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg, etc. up to photo12.jpg
3. Place them in this folder (/public/instagram/)
4. The first photo (photo1.jpg) will appear as the largest item in the grid

Alternatively, you can modify the Life.js component to use your Instagram photos directly
if you set up Instagram Basic Display API.
